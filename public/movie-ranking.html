    <h1>My Favorite Movies... According to David</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
      <hr />
    <h3>Fight Club (1999)</h3>
      <p>Favorite because of the anti-consumerism and for challenging the status quo.</p>
    <h3>The Wolf Man (1941)</h3>
      <p>One of the original horror films and the beginning of the werewolf genre in general.</p>
    <h3>Coco (2017)</h3>
      <p>Original and beautiful, wish they made more movies that revolved around Dia de los Muertos.</p>
